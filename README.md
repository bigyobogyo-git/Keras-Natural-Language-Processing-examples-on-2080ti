# Keras-Natural-Language-Processing-examples-on-2080ti

Using the tensorflow-2.19 environments to run the NLP examples on the GPU. Same server but different virtualenv. Guide is uploaded here as well. 

Again this is just to run the examples and some general bug fixing along the way to help poeple get started with deep learning. I hope this helps people to learn about machine learning and setting up a server.
